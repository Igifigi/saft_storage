# SAFT storage
(Slot Art Festiwal Technika storage system)

## Setup
Install Python 3.8 or later (we recomment Python 3.11 or later) and set up a Python virtual environment. We advise to use a `pyenv` version manager. Now you need to install all the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Now you can `git clone` the repository. You will have to create `saft/localsettings.py` and set `DEBUG` and `SECRET_KEY`.
